**Problem Description**

Here, the program asks for the user's input in the form of sentences. Now the user's input is then translated into some form of gibberish with the help of this translator. 
Sounds illogical, right? But yeah, it's funny. Try implementing your own kind of such translator. Happy Coding! Adios.
